# Language

Here is the mond language written down.

At first, the everything here is split up between the following:

1. Translator
2. Translator tools
3. language grammar
4. language constructed elements ("mond's LCE")
5. "basic" library
6. TransparentLayer


## The Translator

(things both compiler and interpreter have)

...

## Translator tools

1. libbus (The library handler)

...

## language grammar

you don't follow the rules -> syntaxerror

...

## language constructed elements

something like the class that gets created when we use the keyword "class" from
the grammar.

...

## "basic" library

(the translator imports it)

...

## TransparentLayer

Layer in the translator that provides reflection / debugging / seeing what
happens behind.
