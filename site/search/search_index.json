The main goal is not to mix syntax of different languages by personal likes / dislikes, but furthermore to create a language that lets the programmer choose the way he uses mond by himself. Therefore, a use for user-level applications shouldn't restrict hardware-bound, low-level operations. \"You get what you pay for.\" Goals In the first dev-stage, the compiler \"mondc\" and it's subparts are built. If everything goes as planned, mond gets improved, e.g. external support of other languages, (dynamically) linked libraries or executables introduced. In the third stage, important libraries are created and after that more complex, case related libraries designed.","title":"Welcome"},{"location":"#welcome","text":"this page will be used to document the mond language visit language-docs","title":"Welcome"},{"location":"#synopsis","text":"\"mond\" is a general-purpose, partially object oriented, partially functional system programming language.
