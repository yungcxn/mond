# Mond

Mond (ðŸŒ’) is a language which combines simplicity and complexity.
It sounds weird, I know, but here is why:

Many popular languages have functionalities which many of you donâ€˜t like.
Even if youâ€˜ve been using your language quite a while, you sometimes have these time-consuming steps that stop you from being efficient.

I donâ€˜t want you to think that Mond is *THE NEW LANGUAGE*, even because of the fact that there are programming languages for every purpose. 
But anyways: This language is influenced by many great aspects of nearly every known language.

## Possibilites

Mond is a clear OOP-Language, but has completely new aspects, like the predefined methods or the datatype arrangement.
