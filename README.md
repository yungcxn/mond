# Mond

Mond (ðŸŒ’) is a language which combines simplicity and complexity.

## Possibilites

Mond is a clear OOP-Language, but has completely new aspects, like predefined methods or datatype arrangement.

This project began with unsatisfaction with many other
popular programming languages.

## The Interpreter

Mond is only interpreted now.
A compiler will be born in the future...

```WIP :')```
